# Kickstarting with Excel

## Evaluating Kickstarter Data to Identify Trends

### In order to make reccomendations about potential Kickstarter funded projects to maximize chances of success

## We used two independent variables to look at the data in depth

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on launch date was chosen becuase this is something that the project manager could control. We observed successful, failed, and canceled Kickstarters compared to what month of the year they were launched in order to identify trends.
see: Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals was chosen becuase there is some control by the project manager. It also allows us to observe which Kickstarters fail because their goal is not appropriate for the project.

### Challenges with this data included some very sizeable outliers, on both the successful and failed campaigns. Other challenges related to the launch date were we had very small goals that were met very quickly which may skew the launch date success rate.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1-After reviewing the outcomes based on Luanch Date, one could conclude that highest chance of having a successful campaign would be to launch the campaign in May. 2-Conversely, the highest chance of the campaign failing would be if it were launched in October.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
After reviewing the outcomes based on Goals, one could conclude that the Kickstarters highest chance of being successful is when the goal is under $1000. The chances of being successful decline, and the kickstarter is more likely to fail once the goal reaches above $15000.


- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Limitations we have to consider are that we are only looking at two quantitative elements. There may be many qualitative elements that caused certain Kickstarters to fail and others to succeed. We were also limited to just Kickstarter, but there are multiple crowdfunding platforms for projects. Different crowdfunding platforms may or may not be better suited for crowdfunding projects like plays.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
One possibly  interesting graph would be to compare goal to the percent funded. This could reveal more about the successful and failed Kickstarters that were on the edge. Another interesting graphic would be success vs fail rate by country. We could look to see if certain regions support plays more than others to help make more determinations about the success of US Kickstarters.
