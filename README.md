# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends, particulary Kickstarters for Plays
##Observed trends of Successful vs Failed Kickstarters
Kickstarters launched in May had a much greater success rate opposed to the remainder of the year. Additionally Kickstarters launched between October and March showed success rates much closer to failed rates. Failed Kickstarters don't seem to appear to vary much from month to month. ![Outcome Based on Launch Date](![Outcome Based on Launch Date](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89958437/134825931-c871dfa2-f302-493b-96da-73ede8ca0af5.png)
The mean goal of Successful Kickstarters was $5,049 where as the mean goal of failed Kickstarters was $10,544. However, the Median Goal of Successful Kickstarters was $3,000 where the Median of Failed Kickstarters was $5,000. With the mean goal being close to the upper quartile in both successful and failed Kickstarters, the mean of each is being influcenced by excessively high goals. The failed Kickstarters have a significantly higher Standard Deviation than successful Kickstarters, showing the goal of failed Kickstarters were more disperesed than successful Kickstarters. Conversely, failed Kickstarters had a much smaller Standard Deviation than successful Kickstarters. This implies that while there was much more variance in failed kickstarters, the goal was not the reason these Kickstarters failed. Observing the mean pledged along with the Upperquartile, we can infer that the mean pledged was in fact influenced by outliers outside of the normal limits. This shows additional evidence that these Kickstarters likely failed for reasons ofther than their goal.
However, when observing the goals and pledged amounts of Kickstarters that fell within the range of "normal" data, we can see that any play with a goal in excess of $10,250 or a pledged amount of $11,673 should be considered an outlier. There were 38 plays that fell within this range which is influencing the mean.
It is my suggestion that while a play of a budget of $10,000 being successful does fall within the range of normal outcomes, it is less likely to succeed its Kickstarter goal than a play with a smaller budget. I would suggest you optimize your chances of success by ensuring that the campaign starter in May, as Kickstarters have a significantly greater chance of success if launched in May than any other month.
