# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Performing analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends, particulary Kickstarters for Plays
Taking a look to help determine relatationships between successful and unsuccessful kickstarter campaigns for plays.
### US Play Outcomes
While looking at overall successful vs failed plays, we can observe there were 412 successfully launced plays compared to 250 failed launches. Additionally there are 9 active launches. (shown in Sub category statistics chart.png)
In order to maximzie our chances at launching a successful kickstarter campaign, we observed successful campaigns vs unsuccessful campaigns in relation to their launch date (Outcome Based on Launch Date.png). This figure shows a strong relationship with successful campaigns being launched in May whiles the fewest number of successful campaigns were launched in December. It appears that while there is the greatest number of campaigns launched in May, they have a significanlty greater success rate. More work must be done to determine if there are any other factors that infuence the success as well as why May seems to be a drastic outlier month compared to the rest of the year. More work must also be completed to determine if there is a relationship bewteen other variables and the chances of a campaigns success.
